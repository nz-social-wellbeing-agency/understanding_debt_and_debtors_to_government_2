Midway though phase 2 research, we reworked the debt definitions to make them
faster and easier.

This folder contains the revised definitions along with the rows for the control
file that use these revised definitions in place of the original definitions.

To use these definitions:
- Run each SQL file
- Remove the existing debt rows from the measures.xlsx control file
- Add the rows from measure_new.xlsx control file to the measures.xlsx file

Researchers may wish to compare the old and new approaches to understand
how to bettere prepare data for the assembly tool.
- The old approach manually pivots the data
	and creates each varaible as a separate column, requiring a separate label
- The new approach avoids pivtoing that data
	and creates variable labels as part of the SQL view
